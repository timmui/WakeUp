# WakeUp
This is a simple app to keep you awake during those long lectures. Using the Myo, the app can identify when you are dosing off and it will try to wake you up by vibrating the Myo. After a few attempts at waking you up, the app will perform something that will definitely wake you up. Hopefully it doesn't have to get to that point. Please note that this is still in development and may contain (many) bugs and issues.
